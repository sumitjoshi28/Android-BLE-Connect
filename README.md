This is a simple demo application that allows us to scan, and connect to a BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) device using an android app.

This app discovers the services and the characteristics provided by the BLE device and that device acts as a server for the android app, by using this app we can get the data based on the characteristics present in the BLE device.
